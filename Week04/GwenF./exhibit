To start off, I will say that I walked past this gallery three times because I thought that it was just a closed store but I will also say that I was impressed and fascinated by the pieces I saw there. The first piece with the sunset was pretty cool. I think that the motion sensor took in the position of who/whatever was in front of it and the closer the object, the more the sun set. The next piece was a shimmering and velvety curtain that used motion sensors to choose what part of the curtain to open(I had a lot of fun with that), it was lowkey creepy but I loved it. It really embodied elegance the way that the red velvet curtains slowly opened to reveal a shimmering gold layer. The last piece was a desert looking environment. This one was probably the most interesting because of how much movement was involved. The sensors on this piece created a ripple whenever it was activated. I read (skimmed) the description for this piece and the artist, Daniel Rosin, was making a statement about climate change. It took me awhile to realize that the movement of the tiles was mimicking water all while looking like a dry terrain.
 The art pieces were all awesome in my opinion and I don’t know if it was intentional but the entire gallery was dark and it really brought out the beauty in the art pieces. I like how Daniel Rosin made art as a response to current events and I hope to see more work like his Sol piece. The exhibition did inspire me and something that I realized is that i would like to make art that makes a statement. I think the interactive art/media is as great way to draw attention to issues and in turn, start a discussion. As an added bonus, when your work is viewed by a bunch of people, they can see different messages in it that may or may not be what you’re trying to say. That could be a problem but it does kind of force people to come to an eventual understanding or other people’s views.
