For next class, Monday Wedneday 17th.

2 Labs:
 
* Piezo Lab: Make a minature "KeyBoard" with your breadboard and a few buttons.  Have at least 3 buttons play 3 different tones/notes.  If you do not have 3 buttons, use 2 analog sensors, but treat them like they are digital 0:1.

* Motor Lab:  create a similar program to the piezo lab.  Create a sketch whihc allows you to change the direction/degree of  you servo depending on at least 3 digital inputs.

For both labs, take a picture/video of your working circuit.  Draw a schematic diagram of your circuit. Upload a picture of the schematic electrical diagram, a picture of your working physical circuit (ie. breadboard), and your final arduino code to your wednesday_hw directory.
