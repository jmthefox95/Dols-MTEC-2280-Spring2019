For next class, Monday April 15th.

2 Labs:
 
* If you didn't get to this for last class. Review the StateChangeDetection example from the Arduino examples.  Using an RGB LED, use statechange to make the LED change colors with push botton(s).  Try not to use an analog sensor.  

* Use a unique sensor from one of your kits: an FSR, a photosensor, distance sensor, or even one of your own design.  Take this analog sensor and replace the buttons or potentiometers we have have been using so far in our lab demos.  Program a simple interaction either using the sensor for digital or analog output.  This is up to you.

For both labs, take a picture/video of your working circuit.  Draw a schematic diagram of your circuit. Upload a picture of the schematic electrical diagram, a picture of your working physical circuit (ie. breadboard), and your final arduino code to your wednesday_hw directory.
