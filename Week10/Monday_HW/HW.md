 For next class, Wednesday April 10th.
 
 Continue to work with digital and analog sensors.  Review the StateChangeDetection example for Arduino.  Using an RGB LED, use statechange to make the LED change colors with push botton(s) or potentiometers.  Try to replicate what was covered in class.  Take a picture/video of your working circuit.  Upload the picture and code to your monday_hw directory.
