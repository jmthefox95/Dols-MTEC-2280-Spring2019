**This will be due Monday Feb. 11**

**_LAB_**:

Using Proecessing, make one compostition which uses symmetry (radial, horizontal, vertical, etc.).  These can be asymmetrical, but should still be balance.  Try to incorperate:

* Interaction (MousePressed, mouseX, mouseY etc.)
* State changes (booleans)
* Variables
* Changing variables (Animations)

Have fun with this one.  Push yourself to make something interesting and unique.

Please post your homework to this weeks GitHub folder within the Wednesday_HW folder.
