**This will be due Wednesday March 20.**

**_Choose to create either a Game OR a branching Story_**: 

This project should be done using Processing.

_If you choose to make a game_, take inspiration from early arcade games such as Pong or Asteroids.  Games are fun to make but have a lot of logic necessary to make them work.  Your game should have a clear set of rules, point system, a goal, and a way to pause, resume, or restart.

_If you chose to make a story_, look to the structure of small narrative games or 'choose your own adventure' type models.  Your game should have a beginning, middle, and end with a cohesive story line or theme.  Stories should start with one beginning, but branch into a number of potential paths, conflicts, journeys, and resolutions for the user/reader to enjoy.

We will discuss specifics and requirements as we develop our individual projects.

**Schedule**

March 4: Come to class with a idea or a few inspriations which you would like to work with.  Decide by now whether or not you will do a Game or a Story.

March 11: Diagram/Storyboard your project.  If you are doing a game, plan the rules and conditions which should be met in order to earn points, move, defend etc.  If you are doing an interactive story: create a flowchart of how the story will evolve. Where does the main character begin?  What is the perspective?  What conflicts arise?  How does the story evolve?  How does it revolve?

March 13: Come to class with your initial Processing sketch.  At this point you should have your project figured out on paper and will spend  the rest of you time translating your ideas into code.

March 18: Upload your WIP (work in progress) sketch to a personal folder in the midterm section of our class repo.  Come to class with questions and prepared to work in order complete your midterm.

March 20: Midterms are due!  Upload your final working skecth to your folder in the midterm directory.  Come prepared to give a 5 min presenation on you project: what was your idea, how does it work, what were you able to accomplish, what do you wish it could do in the future?
