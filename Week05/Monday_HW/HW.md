**_LAB:_**

Make a 'digital switch'.  Create a sketch which requires the user to meet specific criteria in order for the canvas to change.


Your sketch should try to utilize at least 5 of the comparative statements below:
* AND
* OR
* Equal to
* NOT Equal to
* Less than or Equal to
* Less than
* Greater then or Equal to
* Greater than

Program with intent.  I would suggest first writing out what you would like to happen and write your program based on your planned interaction.
