Great job on you midterms everyone!

For the rest of this class we will be focusing on physical computing and understanding how to design for physical interfaces!!!

For next class (Wednesday, March 27th)

* Bring in materials to prototype a unique switch in the next class.  The components for this switch should be conductive in order to close and open a circuit.

* [Purchase an arduino kit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/170) or [This](https://www.amazon.com/SunFounder-Project-Universal-Starter-Beginner/dp/B00D9NRIGO/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=sunfounder+universal+v2&qid=1553523480&s=gateway&sr=8-1-fkmrnull).  I suggest buying the kit from adafruit.  If you choose another kit, please send it to me for approval before you make your final purchase.  _Please order your kits so they will be available to you by Monday, April 1st_.
