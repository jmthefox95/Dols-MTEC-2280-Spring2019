For next class (Monday, April 1st)

* Bring in your makeshift switches to next class so we can continue what was missed today.  This can be any pairing of 2 conductive metal objects.  My first custom switch was a lock and key mechanism.  Be creative.  

* [Bring to class your Arduino Kit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/170) or [or arduino compatible kit](https://www.amazon.com/SunFounder-Project-Universal-Starter-Beginner/dp/B00D9NRIGO/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=sunfounder+universal+v2&qid=1553523480&s=gateway&sr=8-1-fkmrnull).  I suggest buying the kit from adafruit.  If you choose another kit, please send it to me for approval before you make your final purchase.
