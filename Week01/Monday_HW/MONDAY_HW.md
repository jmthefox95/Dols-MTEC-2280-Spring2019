**_LAB_**: Elegant Composition

[Download Processing](https://processing.org/download/)

Make an elegant composition with simple 2D primitive functions found in the [Processing Reference.](https://processing.org/reference/)  
_I might suggest making a drawing by hand first and translating that image to code in Processing._


* Use a variety of Primitive (ie. ellipse, rectangle, curves etc.)
* Also, experiment with color, stroke weight, and fills.
* When you are done, 'comment' your first and last name at the top of you Processing file. (ie. //FirstName LastName)
* Save your file as the title of your composition.
* **Email me your .pde file** If you are unsure about this, you can also copy and paste me your raw code.

_Have your work done and sent to me before the start of Wednesday's class.  We will discuss and review compositions and any issues we might have run in to._

Good luck and Have fun!
